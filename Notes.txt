React.CreateElement
to make these kind of elements in react , it becomes a little clumsy and lengthy process.So facebook developers created some
thing known as JSX. Its a syntax for writing react code / creating react elements. JSX is different than React.

JSX
JSX is not HTML inside JS. it is having HTML LIKE SYNTAX.
JSX is converted to React.CreateElement using Babel.
JSX written in single line is a valid JSX
In case you want to write in multiple lines then JSX needs to be wrapped inside paranthesis () to be valid. Since babel has to 
understand the JSX for compilation, it has be inside paranthesis in case of multiple lines JSX.
